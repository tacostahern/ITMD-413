Program Description: This program will test the efficiency of multiple sorting
algorithms across lists of multiple sizes which include 10000, 30000, 50000,
70000, and 90000 size arrays. The sorting algorithms that will be tested include
bubble sort, shell sort, and quick sort. The results will be recorded and
plotted in a graph to show the different times.
